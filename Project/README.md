# PORTABLE SPACE HEATER

A space heater is a device used to heat a single, small to medium sized area.This contrasts with central heating, which is used to heat many connected areas, such as the rooms of a house. With the rising costs of heating and cooling a home, you may consider buying space heaters. They save you money and energy, because you’re only heating the room or the space you’re using.  

Small space heaters work by convection (the circulation of air in a room) or radiant heating. Radiant heaters emit infrared radiation that directly heats objects and people within their line of sight, and are a more efficient choice when you will be in a room for only a few hours and can stay within the line of sight of the heater. They can also be more efficient when you will be using a room for a short period because they save energy by directly heating the occupant of the room and the occupant's immediate surroundings rather than the whole room. That’s something to keep in mind as you search for the which space heater is best to keep your family not only warm, but also safe.
